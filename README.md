============================

## Full-Stack Developer | .NET Core | HTML, CSS, JS
Since 2019, I am interested in various fields of IT. After 
exploring areas like Hardware and Software, I decided to focus 
on programming. In 2020, I started learning Front-End Programming 
for the first time as Self Study. I studied Full-Stack Programming 
at Code Academy in 2021. I am constantly updating my skills in this 
field. I am currently developing various types of websites over .Net (MVC).
